# Designers
A set of designer codes

---------------------

Validate designer's code functions at editor's level

GitHub provide search, will allow writing a search component - this will be re-used by other components (starter codes, user-controls)

GitHub repository security is enough to ensure authenticity, integrity and initial objectives.

* Designer code can be a single file or 2, 3, separate files
* Use title, description, keywords in html head will be enough to class designer

---------------------

A designer centralizes and manages main interactions, panel content and how/what feed them.

Remember that, if network allow it, a designer must be able to complete its toolset with starter codes and user-controls from other 
web locations.  A designer can be closed, or open to other "Source codes" by its means.

Editor, at this time, load one designer and must allow changing of designer while authoring a document.

Editorâ€™s code do not load designer at Initialization, it provide a Start Page in case of empty document, default is to make editable 
and wire framed elements.
